When the original owners left, he took over the event and kept it running as “a creative space for poets to come and be able to put their words out publicly.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, after two fellow poets took their lives, Holgerson said it has since transformed into “an opportunity for people to express their needs and catch them before they hurt themselves.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Other people get depressed, other people talk about suicide,” he said. “And when they write these dark poems and present them, other poets who have them slap them on the back and say ‘I know how you feel, I’ve been there, you’re not alone.’”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Puls, senior librarian at Harmony Library, expressed similar sentiments about the importance of wordsmithing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Poetry is something where we’re able to express things that otherwise are difficult to get at,” she said. “It’s deeply personal, but it’s still something that people feel echoes from when they listen to it.”</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://thefrontpagefrcc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Michael-P.-Hill.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-attachment-id=\"15207\" data-permalink=\"https://thefrontpagefrcc.com/2025/06/24/frcc-grays-peak-atrium-hosts-2025-howl-of-the-hearts-competition/michael-p-hill/\" data-orig-file=\"https://thefrontpagefrcc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Michael-P.-Hill.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"6000,4000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5.6&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;ANNACLAIRE_CRUMPTON&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D5600&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1744312532&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;POUDRE RIVER PUBLIC LIBRARY DISTRICT&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;55&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;1800&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.016666666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Michael P.

Hill and Bryan Roth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The teen finalists for this year were Jaliyah Austin, Makari Egbuji, and Lily Young, with honorable mentions for Elinor Bickley and Mylo Welchman.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poem submissions are open in February, while the reading takes place in April during National Poetry Month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More details about Howl of the Hearts can be found on the Poudre Libraries page.<br><a href=\"https://poudrelibraries.org/howl-of-the-hearts-poetry-competition/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://poudrelibraries.org/howl-of-the-hearts-poetry-competition/</a></p>\n",
