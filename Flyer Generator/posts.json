Courtesy of Melinda Myrick.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>In an inquiry that questioned the discrepancies in pay for some teachers at the college, Melinda Myrick, an English instructor at Westminster campus mentioned that there were “glitches caused by the current rollout of the Banner 9 software, which has caused delays in the FLAC (Faculty Load and Compensation) system.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The implementation of a new program brought about hindrances in the timing of faculty payment, proof of a defect in the payroll technology. Additionally, Myrick also shared a news statement dating to June 2024 and promotional poster that provides further context on the payroll problem. The statement shows that this is not the first time FRCC professors have dealt with unpaid labor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another potential explanation for the pay errors lies in the compensation preview statements for faculty. Matt Jamison, the associate vice president for academic success at Westminster campus claimed “Where the confusion may have arisen is that their pay preview, which all faculty members can see before their paycheck is issued, was incomplete.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://thefrontpagefrcc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FRCC_AAUP_Press_Release_20240627_FINAL_page-0001.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"791\" height=\"1024\" data-attachment-id=\"16321\" data-permalink=\"https://thefrontpagefrcc.com/2025/10/14/some-instructors-at-frcc-see-pay-discrepancies/frcc_aaup_press_release_20240627_final_page-0001/\" data-orig-file=\"https://thefrontpagefrcc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FRCC_AAUP_Press_Release_20240627_FINAL_page-0001.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2550,3300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"FRCC_AAUP_Press_Release_20240627_FINAL_page-0001\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://thefrontpagefrcc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FRCC_AAUP_Press_Release_20240627_FINAL_page-0001-232x300.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https://thefrontpagefrcc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FRCC_AAUP_Press_Release_20240627_FINAL_page-0001-791x1024.jpg\" src=\"https://thefrontpagefrcc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FRCC_AAUP_Press_Release_20240627_FINAL_page-0001-791x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16321\" srcset=\"https://thefrontpagefrcc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FRCC_AAUP_Press_Release_20240627_FINAL_page-0001-791x1024.jpg 791w, https://thefrontpagefrcc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FRCC_AAUP_Press_Release_20240627_FINAL_page-0001-232x300.jpg 232w, https://thefrontpagefrcc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FRCC_AAUP_Press_Release_20240627_FINAL_page-0001-768x994.jpg 768w, https://thefrontpagefrcc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FRCC_AAUP_Press_Release_20240627_FINAL_page-0001-1187x1536.jpg 1187w, https://thefrontpagefrcc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FRCC_AAUP_Press_Release_20240627_FINAL_page-0001-1583x2048.jpg 1583w, https://thefrontpagefrcc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FRCC_AAUP_Press_Release_20240627_FINAL_page-0001-1200x1553.jpg 1200w, https://thefrontpagefrcc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FRCC_AAUP_Press_Release_20240627_FINAL_page-0001-83x108.jpg 83w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 791px) 100vw, 791px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">A news statement by the AAUP on June 27, 2024 discusses unpaid labor for FRCC instructors during the summer of 2024.

Jamison assured “the college is committed to paying employees correctly and on time” and specified that “we are working with CCCS to improve our systems to minimize errors moving forward.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The college is collaborating with the Colorado Community College System to optimize its payroll processes.</p>\n",
